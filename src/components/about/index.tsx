            I'm a Software engineer with over 4 and half years of working
            experience. I derive joy in performing my duties with the
            technologies I've used throughout my working experience. I also love
            to learn new technologies and expand my knowledge as a software
            engineer. Solving problems and creating new ideas and inventions is
            like an everyday task for me, it keeps me going.
